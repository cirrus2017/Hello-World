# Hello-World
First Repository

Hi there - 
This is my first GitHub project. I'm starting from scratch and plan to learn a lot of cool things w/ this web development project. I aim to start a website where I can share my reviews and views on things that interest or bother me in this world. I aim to come up w/ meaningful, original ideas to be shared here and hope to find like minded audience and have discussions with them. Finally, I would like to start a digital magazine. I have a very vague idea for the subjects this e-magazine will touch upon but I hope to have content around, society, movies, music and if possible trends which will shape the desirable future.

Cheers,
The Leppard
